# Embedded Pool

## Project Overview

**Embedded Pool** is an intensive project aimed at learning embedded programming using a development board created by 42Chips featuring an [ATmega328P](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATmega48A-PA-88A-PA-168A-PA-328-P-DS-DS40002061A.pdf) microcontroller. This project, which spans over two weeks, involves studying official documentation of the microcontroller and various peripherals, understanding the schematics of the board, and mastering several communication protocols.

Each day, we focused on a new aspect of the development board, culminating in weekend rush projects that required quick thinking and teamwork. This README provides a detailed overview of the project, what was learned each day, and the overall objectives achieved.
